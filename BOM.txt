Resistors
5x	15-20k	R1,R3,R7,R8,R9	1/4W (this are the led resistors, use 10k to 20k. 10K quite bright, 20K tammed

Caps
1x 100nF	C1 CERAMIC (deprecated, not needed, it produces a subtle filtering)
1x	1uF-10uF	C5	ELECTROLITYC	 (anything from 1 to 10uf or more should work)	

Hardware
3x	POT	POT1,POT2,POT3	ALPS VERTICAL TYPE B10K LINEAR	(pretty much any linear pot will work, recommended between 10K and 100K)
2x		SW1,SW2	SWITCH-6X6X5 milimeters, Through Hole	

Misc
1x	U1	ARDUINO_NANO (Programmed)				
4x	LED1,LED2,LED3,LED4	(The color you prefer)
