WhatÂ´s new Version 0.99:

Equation no 15 (all leds on) reworked so now is way more melodic / playable
Equation no 16 (all leds off) brand new one. It was the empty slot

Keyboard combos changes:

To modify SAMPLE RATE >>> long press LEFT button + tweak knob 1
To modify reversal time >>> long press RIGHT button + tweak knob 1
To ENTER or EXIT the leds showing the GATES (to synch with other gear)  >>>
press BOTH buttons long (+1 second) and release LEFT button FIRST

This keyboard changes serve a function: it does not change in which program you are after long press, so you can modify both RATE and TIME without exiting the program you are tweaking
