# glitch-storm

Glitch Storm is an exploratory synth that can be build and soldered even for total beginners. It produces a plethora of blips and blops ranging for chords, techno rhythms to alien soundscapes and FXs.

At its core is a Bytebeat synth but this one is interactive. You play it tuning into frequencies and soundscapes. You have four dimensions in it to explore, three ones via the knobs and a forth one via buttons, changing the equation that is playing.

The unit is able to be played as a standalone or in the context of one studio or modular.

Is quite good for pinging filters too and can enter in an easteregg mode for it to trigger gate outs for synchronizing external gear with it.

Please note that Rev 1.0 does no need the bridges to work. So the revision with four pots needs the bridges. The new one with 3 pots dont need it
